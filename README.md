## My Current Hobby Project : [Unfinished Business](https://www.unfinishedbusiness.dev/)
- I'll build out small, functional prototypes and post them here. It's a testing ground
- Sometimes it's ideas, sometimes it's just cool tech I wanted to get my hands-on
- I'll add polish to it as I go, but most of my free time I'll spend building on existing or new ideas instead of polishing a portfolio

## My Former Side Project turned VC backed Startup: [Fonbnk](https://www.fonbnk.com)
- Went from idea to prototype to VC backed company that went through Techstars Accelerator.
- Fonbnk is a company trying to become the default exchange in Africa for converting prepaid mobile airtime to crypto and vice versa.

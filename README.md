# Hello ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my page

## My Main Gig: [Rasgo](https://www.rasgoml.com/)
- Rasgo is a Data Analytics startup that brings GPT4 to your Datawarehouse (As long as that Datawarehouse is Snowflake or BigQuery).

## My Current Hobby Project : [99prompts](https://99prompts.io)
- There are a lot of tools out there for organizing and sharing prompts, but this was my take.
- The main thing I wanted was a way to let people chat with a prompt I had written without exposing the prompt itself because a well written prompt is basically IP
- Also, I wanted a way to group similar AI generated images together, and attach the prompt to that image for easy reference

## My Former Side Project: [Fonbnk](https://www.fonbnk.com)
- Fonbnk is a company trying to become the default exchange in Africa for converting prepaid mobile airtime to crypto and vice versa. At least, that was it's goal when I left the project a few years ago.
  
 ## Another Fun Project:
  - Repo: https://github.com/mcmaimas/Spotify
  - I listen to a lot of music and one of my favorite things to do is find new artists. Spotify does a good job of telling me the top n recommended artists, but it doesn't provide an easy way of making playlists with that information. This project fixes that by letting me search for an artist, and then generating/saving a playlist to my profile of the top n songs of the top 20 related artists

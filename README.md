 ## My Favorite Fun Project:
  - Repo: https://github.com/mcmaimas/Spotify
  - I listen to a lot of music and one of my favorite things to do is find new artists. Spotify does a good job of telling me the top n recommended artists, but it doesn't provide an easy way of making playlists with that information. This project fixes that by letting me search for an artist, and then generating/saving a playlist to my profile of the top n songs of the top 20 related artists

 ## My Current Fun Project:
  - Repo: https://github.com/mcmaimas/Spotify
  
  - Here is my Spotify process. Find a new artist, go to their #1 most related artist, play that related artists top song, go back to the original artist, go to #2 most related 
  artist, etc... all the way through 20 related artists. 
  
  - I did this a handful of times, but luckily I am a developer and this is BFS plain and simple so I used Spotify's API to help me build a solution. Now I go to a UI, type in an   artist name, click generate and a playlist is automatically added to my spotify account that has the #1 song of all related artists. 
 
  
## My "Portfolio":
  - GH Page: https://mcmaimas.github.io/portfolio/
  - Honesty it's not much of a portfolio, but once I found the library react-spring I knew I had to build something with it.
  
  
## My Previous Fun Project:
  - GH Page: https://mcmaimas.github.io/BeerMe/
  - Me and some friends had the totally original idea of building a beer suggestor app awhile ago. Nothing ever came of it, but I did build a UI that I liked. Mainly I liked the       horizontal scrolling feature (you need a touch screen).

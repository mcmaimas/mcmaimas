# Welcome to my page ðŸ‘‹

## My Main Gig: [Rasgo](https://www.rasgoml.com/)
- We help enterprises build out and maintain a metadata layer for their cloud data warehouse. This metadata, along with their prompt, is fed into the LLM of their choosing to get results

## My Current Hobby Project : [Unfinished Business](https://www.unfinishedbusiness.dev/)
- I'll build out small, functional prototypes and post them here. It's a testing ground
- Sometimes it's ideas, sometimes it's just cool tech I wanted to get my hands-on
- I'll add polish to it as I go, but most of my free time I'll spend building on existing or new ideas instead of polishing a portfolio


## My Last Hobby Project : [99prompts](https://99prompts.io) deprecated
- The main thing I wanted was a way to let people chat with a prompt I had written without exposing the prompt itself because a well written prompt is basically IP
- Also, I wanted a way to group similar AI generated images together, and attach the prompt to that image for easy reference


## My Former Side Project turned VC backed Startup: [Fonbnk](https://www.fonbnk.com)
- Fonbnk is a company trying to become the default exchange in Africa for converting prepaid mobile airtime to crypto and vice versa. At least, that was it's goal when I left the project a few years ago.
